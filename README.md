My vision was to create a desktop calendar that would function like a physical calendar in that it would always be visible. Thus the application is made to consume very few system resources when idle (window not active and not being interacted with), allowing for it to be constantly displayed on an additional monitor. I personally have the application always set to fullscreen on my third monitor.

## How to use
You can either download and extract one of the precomplied releases, possibly available in the releases tab, or you can compile the project yourself.

The executable should be in a folder that also contains an "images" folder and a "taskdeck_data" folder. Deleting these folders or running the executable in a place where these folders are not present may cause the application to not function if it is unable to create these folders.

The application allows for the user to place any image (of reasonable size) in to the images folder and select it in the app settings to function as the background image for the application.


## Operating system compatability
The application has been built for windows 11 and the releases offered will target windows. However, it is unlikely that major changes would need to be made in order to make it work on other operating systems.


## Planned changes
- add ability to scroll upward in order to view past events
